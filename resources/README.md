# Resources folder

This folder should contain, by default:

* `crate.j2a`: A sprite of an empty 15 ammo crate, to be used as a template for
  custom weapons that don't have their own sprite. Thanks to Seren for making 
  it.
* `Jazz2.pal`: The default Jazz Jackrabbit 2 palette, to render sprites if no
  other palette is provided.
  
You should put additional J2A files in here as required by levels. Usually
copying all J2A files in your game folder and dumping them here is sufficient.
